      <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ pound sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add tortellini. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tortellini<br>
          floats to the top and the filling is hot, about 5 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken breast in hot oil until no longer<br> pink
          in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt butter in another skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic powder until mushrooms<br> begin to 
          soften, about 3 minutes. Stir heavy cream into mushrooms and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to<br> medium-low and simmer 
          until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese, parsley, and salt.<br> Continue to cook until cheese is
           melted, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir tortellini and chicken into mushroom-cream sauce. Simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
